# Real-time-face-mask-detection

This repository contains python code to detect faces with or without masks. 

Concept of DeepNeuralNetworks is used to prepare the model to detect the faces with or without masks. And, to prepare the model I've used ResNet50_v2 architecture to prepare the CNN.

OpenCV is used to detect faces in real-time using the Video Stream from the WebCam.

### Requirements
- Tensorflow(>2.0)
- [ResNet50_v2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/residual-networks-resnet-deep-learning/#:~:text=ResNet%2C%20which%20was%20proposed%20in%202015%20by%20researchers,we%20use%20a%20technique%20called%20skip%20connections%20.)
- OpenCV
